# palindrome-program

The above program is for checking if a string is Palindrome or not

 A string is said to be palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as string. For example, “radar” is a palindrome because reverse of "radar" is "radar" itself, but “radix” is not a palindrome since reverse of 'radix' is 'xidar' and not 'radix'. Therefore we say it's not a Palindrome.
